            <div class="method-content-collapsible">
                <p>This method leverages Xvideos to attract potential victims by uploading Roblox condo content and driving traffic to your Discord server.</p>
                
                <h4>Step 1: Create an Xvideos Account</h4>
                <p>Sign up for a free account on <a href="https://www.xvideos.com/" target="_blank">Xvideos.com</a> using a disposable email if desired.</p>
                
                <h4>Step 2: Source Content</h4>
                <p>Download Roblox condo videos from Twitter, focusing on popular games like Da Hood. Look for content featuring popular avatars like "Ekitten" for better engagement.</p>
                
                <h4>Step 3: Upload to Xvideos</h4>
                <p>Upload the downloaded content to your Xvideos account. In the video title, include your Discord invite link to drive traffic to your server.</p>
                
                <h4>Step 4: Grow Your Discord Server</h4>
                <p>Create a channel called "#our-uploads" in your Discord server where you'll periodically post fake game links. This keeps users engaged and coming back.</p>
                
                <h4>Step 5: Scale Up</h4>
                <p>For best results, create multiple Xvideos accounts and upload different videos to each one. Cross-promote between your videos in the descriptions.</p>
                
                <p class="warning">üí° <strong>Note:</strong> This method can generate 2,000-5,000+ views within 3 days, making it one of the most effective ways to gather potential targets with minimal effort.</p>

         <!-- Featured Method: BEST TikTok Method -->
        <section class="featured-method-card method-card">
            <h2 class="method-title-trigger">‚≠ê BEST TikTok Method ‚≠ê</h2>
            <div class="method-content-collapsible">
                <p>This method involves streaming pre-recorded content on TikTok to gather engagement and increase your beam count. Follow these steps to set it up:</p>
                
                <h4>Step 1: Prepare Your Video</h4>
                <p>You will need a pre-recorded video that you plan to stream. This video will be at the bottom of this thread, so ensure it‚Äôs ready to go!</p>
                
                <h4>Step 2: Add Your Private Server/Profile Link</h4>
                <p>Once your video is ready, go to your TikTok profile. In your TikTok bio, you must add either your private server link or your profile link (whichever you prefer).</p>
                <p>If you have at least 1,000 followers, you can add a clickable website link to your bio. If you don‚Äôt have 1k followers, you can‚Äôt add a clickable link.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also use bio.link or Linktree to share multiple links in your TikTok bio. These services allow you to create a single link that leads to multiple destinations, such as your private server, profile, or any other relevant links.</p>
                
                <h4>Step 3: Start the Live Stream Using an External Device</h4>
                <p>Use a separate device to initiate the stream.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On your device, press the <strong>+</strong> button to go live.</li>
                    <li>Select "Mobile Gaming" as the category for your stream.</li>
                    <li>Once your stream begins, let it sit all day long ‚Äî you‚Äôre essentially streaming your pre-recorded content as a "live" video.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> The stream will look like a real live video, but it‚Äôs actually pre-recorded.</p>
                
                <h4>What Is a Pre-Recorded Stream on TikTok?</h4>
                <p>A pre-recorded stream is when you play a video as if it‚Äôs live, even though it was recorded earlier. This technique allows you to keep your stream running without having to do anything in real time. It works well for gaining engagement, as viewers think they are watching a live event.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Be prepared for 50-100 beams every day by maintaining this setup and finding more pre-recorded videos to keep the stream going.</p>
                
                <h4>Final Tips:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>This method can help you grow your follower count and engagement without actively streaming in real-time.</li>
                    <li>Keep an eye on your TikTok account to make sure the stream remains live and that your links in the bio are working.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Download Pre-Recorded Files:</h4>

                    <li>When someone DMs you, chat and negotiate a trade that seems very favorable to them.</li>
                    <li>Once they‚Äôre convinced, send them your fake private server link.</li>

                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The more servers you join and the more active you are, the more targets you'll get!</p>

                        <li>Go into any game with a decent amount of rich girls/boys and find someone that is rich and has premium. (Or just find anyone you know and you don't really like.)</li>

                        <li>Ask if you wanna be friends and say that you don't have any and that you are a bit awkward.</li>
                        <li>They will mostly say yes; if they don't, then just find someone else.</li>
                        <li>Ask for their Discord. They will most likely give it to you.</li>
                        <li>Be nice and kind, always message something to them, make jokes until they like you.</li>
                        <li>If they ask personal stuff, just make stuff up.</li>

                        <li>Ask her if she can make you a really nice avatar and send her your password (make sure your trades are off and you have a pin).</li>
                        <li>Now, ask her if you can make an avatar for her. She will say yes 95% of the time.</li>
                        <li>Get her limiteds.</li>

            <h3 class="method-title-trigger">üîó Friend Chain Method üé£</h3>
            <div class="method-content-collapsible">
                <p>This tutorial outlines a phishing technique called the "Friend Chain Method" used in Roblox to trick players into revealing their account credentials by leveraging trust and social engineering through Discord.</p>

                <h4>Step 1: Compromising a Roblox Account</h4>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Gain access to a legitimate Roblox account to exploit the trust of its friends.</p>
                <p><strong>Process:</strong> The attacker targets a Roblox player who has fallen for a previous phishing scam. Once the account is compromised (e.g., through stolen credentials), the attacker uses it to impersonate the legitimate user.</p>

                <h4>Step 2: Prompting Victims to Share Discord Contact Information</h4>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Trick the victim‚Äôs friends into providing their Discord usernames to move communication to a less moderated platform.</p>
                <p><strong>Process:</strong> Using the compromised Roblox account, the attacker sends private messages to the victim‚Äôs friends list in Roblox. The message is crafted to sound urgent and personal, leveraging the excitement of a new game, e.g.:</p>
                <div class="code-block-container">
                    <pre><code>Hey! My Discord account got deleted, so I made a new one. Add me quick at [Discord username]! A new Roblox horror game just dropped, and I want to play it with you! üò±</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>The attacker avoids sending a phishing link in Roblox to reduce suspicion and bypass Roblox‚Äôs chat filters.</p>

                <h4>Step 3: Sending Phishing Links via Discord</h4>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Deliver the phishing link through Discord, where users are more likely to trust direct messages.</p>
                <p><strong>Process:</strong> Once the victim adds the attacker‚Äôs fake Discord account, the attacker sends a follow-up message, e.g.:</p>
                <div class="code-block-container">
                    <pre><code>Yo, the new horror game is insane! You need to join the event to play with me. Sign up here to get access: http://roblox-horror-event.com/login</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>The link leads to a fake Roblox login page that mimics the official site (<code>roblox.com</code>). The page prompts users to enter their username, password, and sometimes 2FA code, under the pretext of ‚Äúverifying your account to join the event.‚Äù The Discord account may use a profile picture or username similar to the compromised Roblox account to maintain trust.</p>

                <h4>Step 4: Creating a Viral Effect</h4>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Encourage victims to unknowingly spread the scam further.</p>
                <p><strong>Process:</strong> After a victim enters their credentials on the fake login page, their Roblox account may be compromised. The attacker repeats the process using the newly compromised account, messaging the victim‚Äôs friends in Roblox to collect more Discord contacts and continuing the cycle on Discord with phishing links. The attacker may also join public Discord servers related to Roblox (e.g., for Adopt Me or Blox Fruits) and post similar messages about the ‚Äúnew horror game,‚Äù spreading the scam to a wider audience.</p>

                <h4>Why This Method Is Effective</h4>
                <p><strong>Trust Exploitation:</strong> Messages from a friend‚Äôs Roblox account, followed by a seemingly legitimate Discord account, build trust and reduce suspicion.</p>
                <p><strong>Platform Shift:</strong> Moving from Roblox‚Äôs moderated chat to Discord bypasses Roblox‚Äôs strict chat filters, making it easier to send phishing links undetected.</p>
                <p><strong>Excitement and Urgency:</strong> The promise of a new horror game and the urgency of ‚Äúadd me quick‚Äù exploit the excitement of Roblox‚Äôs community, especially younger players.</p>
                <p><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> The attacker uses a conversational, friendly tone with emojis and game-specific references (e.g., ‚Äúnew horror game‚Äù) to blend in with the Roblox community.</p>
